However, the correct calculations based on the gold answer show that the smallest positive integer solution is actually \\( x = 159 \\), derived from solving the equation \\( 19x - 180n = 141 \\) or the modular equivalence \\( 19x \\equiv 141 \\pmod{180} \\). Therefore, the prediction is incorrect.", "is_correct": false}}
{"4999": {"rationale": "The prediction states that the direction vector of the line results from solving the equation \\(M \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}\\) with the reflection matrix provided. The response concludes that the vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which differs from the gold answer. The gold answer correctly identifies the vector as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) following the same process. The reflection conditions are accurately expressed, but there is a mistake in the prediction's final calculations leading to the incorrect sign for the components of the direction vector. The prediction correctly analyzes the reflection properties and sets up the equations but fails to correctly solve them, arriving at the incorrect vector. So, the prediction is not correct.", "is_correct": false}}
