The calculations lead to the same answer as the gold answer, confirming the reasoning is valid. Therefore, the prediction is correct.", "is_correct": true}}
{"4989": {"rationale": "The prediction made is incorrect because it leads to a different expression for the sum a + b + c than the gold answer, which correctly evaluates to a specific value (14).

{"4991": {"rationale": "The prediction presents a different method for solving the problem compared to the gold answer, which correctly identifies the roots using a specific quadratic equation derived from the initial conditions. The prediction uses the transformation with $y=x+\tan 20^\textcirc$ to try to find a simpler form. However, it arrives at incorrect solutions of $3\tan 20^\textcirc$, $3\tan 40^\textcirc$, and $3\tan 60^\textcirc$, instead of the correct pairs of roots that were found in the gold answer. The gold answer's derived roots are $2+\tan 20^\textcirc$, $-2+\tan 20^\textcirc$, which are not addressed at all in the prediction.

The prediction accurately describes the process of rotating the complex number `z` around point `c` by an angle of `pi/4`, referencing the correct formula for rotation and providing the steps leading to the computation of `w`. However, it has redundant and overly repeated calculations in its elaboration that contributes to length without altering the final expression, but it does arrive at the correct output.
