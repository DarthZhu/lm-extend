{"4990": {"rationale": "The prediction is incorrect because it claims the squared determinant is equal to the product of the squared distances between points, which is not true. The gold answer correctly identifies the square of the determinant as 144, while the prediction inaccurately suggests it would be 3600 based on an incorrect formula for the relationship between the determinant and the distances.", "is_correct": false}}
{"4991": {"rationale": "The prediction provided states that the solution to the equation involves establishing a relationship between the tangents of specific angles and leads to the conclusion that the only solution is \\(x = \\tan 40^{\\circ}\\). However, the gold answer details a quadratic equation with roots \\(2 + \\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(-2 + \\sqrt{3}\\), suggesting that there are two valid solutions rather than one. Therefore, the prediction that the only solution is \\(\\tan 40^{\\circ}\\) is incorrect given the gold answer indicates multiple roots for the quadratic derived, which must include more than one valid solution.", "is_correct": false}}
{"4992": {"rationale": "The prediction provides a method to simplify the original expression using trigonometric identities but ultimately fails to confirm the exact numerical result, which is crucial given that the gold answer is stated as 12. The approach outlined in the prediction diverges from the specific derivation provided in the gold answer, which systematically leads to the exact value without ambiguity. Thus, because the prediction does not find the correct result, it is not accurate.", "is_correct": false}}
{"4993": {"rationale": "The prediction incorrectly computes the rotation of the complex number $z$ about $c$ by using incorrect initial translations and calculations. It does not align with the gold answer, which correctly arrives at $w = 6 - 5i$. The correct approach should retain the proper computations when translating and rotating the complex number, resulting in different terms than what was derived here. Hence, the suggestion of $w = -1 - 6i$ is incorrect.", "is_correct": false}}
{"4994": {"rationale": "The prediction correctly identifies that the dot product of two vectors can be expressed as \\( \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = \\|\\mathbf{v}\\| \\|\\mathbf{w}\\| \\cos \\theta \\) and explains that the cosine function ranges from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\). Additionally, it accurately calculates the minimum value of the dot product based on the magnitudes of the vectors and the value of \\( \\cos \\theta\\). Since all steps align correctly with the gold answer, the prediction is correct.", "is_correct": true}}
{"4995": {"rationale": "The prediction incorrectly states that \\( \\tan x \\) is undefined and provides incorrect reasoning for calculating \\( \\sin x \\) and \\( \\cos x \\). In fact, using the correct substitution and solving the resulting equations yields \\( \\sin x = \\frac{4}{5} \\) and \\( \\cos x = -\\frac{3}{5} \\), leading to the correct calculation of \\( \\tan x = -\\frac{4}{3} \\). Since the gold answer provides the correct value for \\( \\tan x \\), the prediction does not match the correct answer, resulting in an incorrect evaluation.", "is_correct": false}}
{"4996": {"rationale": "The prediction arrives at a normal vector of a plane that is orthogonal to the columns of the projection matrix, leading to the conclusion of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\). However, the gold answer provides a correct computation showing the normal vector as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The two answers are different, which indicates that the prediction is incorrect.", "is_correct": false}}
{"4997": {"rationale": "The prediction is an accurate and detailed explanation of how to derive the expression for \\( \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} \\) given that \\( \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{0} \\). It correctly follows the logical steps and calculations laid out in the gold answer, ultimately arriving at the conclusion that \\( \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} = -\\frac{155}{2} \\). The prediction matches the gold answer perfectly. Thus, it is correct.", "is_correct": true}}
{"4998": {"rationale": "The prediction incorrectly concludes that the smallest positive integer solution for x is 24, while the gold answer correctly derives that x = 159 is the solution. The prediction misapplies the methods used to solve the equation and incorrectly calculates the solutions for various n values, leading to an incorrect conclusion.", "is_correct": false}}
{"4999": {"rationale": "The prediction correctly identifies the direction vector of the line \\( \\ell \\) as an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 of the given matrix. The step-by-step verification of the eigenvector process leads to the same conclusion that the eigenvector indeed is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \\ -2 \\ \\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), consistent with the derivation provided in the gold answer. Furthermore, the final specification of properties like \\( a > 0 \\) and \\( \\gcd(|a|, |b|, |c|) = 1 \\) reaffirms the choice of the vector. Overall, the prediction aligns well with the content of the gold answer.", "is_correct": true}}
