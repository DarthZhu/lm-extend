{"13161": "A. The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely."}
{"13162": "D. All of these options."}
{"13163": "C. The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC."}

{"13166": "B. Computer experts"}
{"13167": "B. All of these options."}
{"13168": "A. Conventional constructivists view constructivism as a bridge between rationalist and reflectivist approaches, enabling both to benefit from the insights of the other. Conversely, critical constructivists argue that this approach simply reproduces the binary distinctions that characterize positivist methodology."}

{"13170": "A. The Orient is a constructed subject that is imagined as inferior, irrational, and backward, in comparison to the West."}

{"13172": "B."}
{"13173": "C."}
{"13174": "C. The security paradigm of recent years has been to some extent a reversion to 'liddism'; keeping the lid on a potentially fractured international system, without redress to the critical underlying causes of the problems."}
{"13175": "B. Environmental security contends that the principle threat to the ecological integrity is human activity and therefore humans can be secured to the extent that welfare is protected at the domestic level. The reason for action is to be found in individual and national interests."}
{"13176": "C. The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities."}
{"13177": "C. The subaltern refers to populations that are marginalised or outside of the hegemonic power structure."}
{"13178": "D. Gender roles are a social construct; the values that we attribute to masculinity or femininity, such as strength or care-giving, are the product of shared social ideals rather than innate biological properties. Men and women are equally able to care effectively for children or to conduct violent and aggressive behaviour. However, social constructs of gender roles are pervasive, and women are likely to be victims of gender-based violence in conflict whilst men are more likely to be involved as perpetrators of violence."}
{"13179": "B. All of these options."}
{"13180": "A. 1987"}
{"13181": "D. All of these options."}
{"13182": "D. All of these options."}
{"13183": "C. All of these."}
{"13184": "C."}
{"13185": "D. The terms 'transnational crime' and 'organized crime' are sometimes used interchangeably but not all transnational crime will be committed by an organized group nor will all organized groups engage in transnational crime. The pursuit of profit for illicit activity eludes definition and may include those individuals or businesses that engage in occasional transnational criminal activity but are otherwise legitimate operatives."}
{"13186": "D. The existing mechanisms for monitoring and treating infectious disease within the international system are capable of effectively containing pandemic outbreaks."}
{"13187": "A. Although often missing from the traditional literature on war and security, women frequently serve the purposes of nationalise causes, with nationalism often presented in highly gendered and female terms, where women are symbols of statehood."}
{"13188": "A. Recent inquiry into the way in which women have been treated both in and after war has revealed a degree of ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women. While women have often been the targets of violence by the enemy in conflict, it is also the case that they may suffer at the hands of their \"protectors\". This strengthens the argument for female soldiers to be engaged in certain types of peacekeeping work, particularly in post-conflict situations."}
{"13189": "D. IFIs identified the economic failings of developing countries as being the result of political problems. Thus, IFIs adopted an approach that involved political and economic restructuring of these states, coercing governments into the adoption of specific financial policies designed to promote debt repayment and economic development."}
{"13190": "D. When the audience are convinced via the speech act or the securitizing actor but fail to grant that actor the special rights requested in order to address the proposed threat."}
{"13191": "D. All of these options."}
{"13192": "C."}
{"13193": "D. Poststructuralism accepts the form and foundations for knowledge claims that dominate the security studies debate. This has brought it into confrontation with the critical studies community, having little to contribute to the understanding of the ways in which knowledge is constructed."}
{"13194": "D. All of these options."}
{"13195": "C. Post-structuralism and constructivism are ill-defined theories that are better described as political orientations, applicable in vague terms but lacking the substance required by scholars in contemporary security studies."}
{"13196": "A. An approach to security that applies critical knowledge to established orthodoxies of security studies."}
{"13197": "D. An issue can be securitized, that is framed as a security question, when it is moved from the politicized to the securitized sphere. During the securitization process, the securitizing actor(s) use discourse to persuade an audience that the issue at hand is one of urgency and priority, and that it presents an existential threat to some referent object."}
{"13198": "D. A global market that has demonstrated the ability, if left unchecked, to reduce poverty and make substantial economic gains."}
{"13199": "D. All of these options."}
{"13200": "D. The articulation of an issue as a security threat is referred to as a speech act. This speech act is presented to an audience by a securitizing actor. This actor attempts to convince that audience of the credibility of the issue as an existential threat to a specific referent object. If successful, the audience is convinced and the securitizing actor is granted recourse to legitimately use extraordinary measures in response to the threat."}
{"13201": "C. By regarding the state as the most important actor, constructivism neglects internationalization in a globalized world."}
{"13202": "D. Terrorism is a broad concept that is understood to denote the threat or use of organized violence for the attainment of political objectives. The definition may therefore be inclusive of governments as targets or perpetrators and cases of war (hot and cold) where terror and counter-terror measures are tactics of either side."}
{"13203": "A. By regarding security as a socially constructed concept, constructivists assert that militarization is the result of governmental decisions based on shared values and cultural norms that underpin their conception of what constitutes a security risk. Accordingly, different governments will identify different threats and react in different ways."}
{"13204": "A. HM agrees with the idea that security can be viewed using a sectoral framework, and recognises the depth of analysis that is enabled by such an approach."}
{"13205": "B. Peace research, in contrast to university IR, was under a great deal of pressure to deal with relevant issues with a high expectation of immediate delivery of policy answers."}
{"13206": "B. The nation state does not exist as a unitary actor within the international system."}
{"13207": "D. All of these options."}
{"13208": "A. Deterrence theory and game theory became highly influential within the academic world and gained centrality politically because the nature of the object allowed for a high degree of normative theorization which was accompanied by a mood of technological pessimism that fostered an ethos of critique."}
{"13209": "A. Human migration will arise as a result of global inequalities in the distribution of power, wealth, and resources. Disempowerment of populations will lead to competition and violence, manifested in transnational movements; and environmental threats and resources scarcity will lead to conflict."}
{"13210": "B. The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism. The problem thus far is that no one case of enforced neo-liberalism, either through conditionalities, regime change, peace-building, has succeeded in transforming a weak state into a strong state."}
{"13211": "C. All of these options."}
{"13212": "D. The combination of nuclear weapons and Cold War political considerations required a highly cohesive, strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political and military planning."}
{"13213": "D. All of these."}
{"13214": "D. Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians. Weak state structures might result in sabotage, accidental use, or even theft. There is also the problem of states developing technology under the guise of deterrence whilst having ulterior motives. Domestic pressures may result in a regime gravitating towards nuclear war fighting strategies to win a rapid victory and strengthen status."}
{"13215": "D. All of these options."}
{"13216": "A. To describe the international as hierarchically ordered and comprised of a dense set of constructed political, economic, social, military and cultural relations."}
{"13217": "D. 1991 Gulf War."}
{"13218": "B. A agenda for peace; peacekeeping, peace-making and conflict prevention as priorities for avoiding military confrontations."}
{"13219": "D. All of these options."}
{"13220": "A. Economics as the science of individuals making decisions, and applying economic science to security, allows us to understand, predict, and respond to the behaviour of states and other security actors."}
{"13221": "D. The impact of environmental problems seems unlikely to diminish so that the relevance of environmental security for policy will likely increase, particularly multilateral action on common security concerns to achieve forms of social organization that are ecologically sustainable. In some sense, current practices of national security are an impediment to achieving environmental security for all people."}
{"13222": "C. An 'energy security nexus' exists in the international system because the geographical distribution of energy supply and demand are not equal; thus states are drawn into complex and intertwined relationships with one another."}
{"13223": "D. All of these options."}
{"13224": "A. The international system is shaped through colonised discourse that establishes notions of certain states as inferior to others."}
{"13225": "C. The different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy: the problem-solving tradition in US political science vs. the critical studies in Europe."}
{"13226": "A. Traditional theories explain international politics as the distribution of power among members of an international system, and specifically as the balance of power amongst major states. The relative power and the constraints of a state are reflective of the security strategy of that state."}
{"13227": "C."}
{"13228": "A. If a threat posed by one group to another is military - particularly when linked to the defence of the historic homeland - armed response is required. At the intra-state level, many societal groups have no such means of armed protection and are compelled to employ non-military counter-measures."}
{"13229": "B. A wholesale shift in the way warfare is conducted and understood."}
{"13230": "D. Historical materialism can concern both human rights and economic rights. It has been an important part of anti-globalisation and alternative-globalisation movements, including the Occupy protests."}
{"13231": "D. The international society is governed by norms of Westphalian sovereignty that advocate non-intervention and the respect of state sovereignty as a means of achieving security. These norms are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which bans the use of force between states except in self-defence or when authorized by the UN."}
{"13232": "D. All of these options."}
{"13233": "C. With access to digital information, such as media and the internet, disempowered populations will become aware of their own exclusion and the inequalities of the global system. This could lead to widespread frustration and revolution."}
{"13234": "A. An increase in non-traditional security threats."}
{"13235": "C. All of these options."}
{"13236": "C."}
{"13237": "B. Diplomacy"}
{"13238": "D. All of these."}
{"13239": "A."}
{"13240": "C. The Ideal Policy provides an expansive framework, firstly for the examination of a maximum number of probable causal conditions and secondly to make the conditions applicable to the contextual factors relating to the use of coercive diplomacy."}
{"13241": "D. All of the above"}
{"13242": "A. Realism is a set of approaches to Security Studies that focuses on states, and tries to determine which strategy a state should adopt to achieve security and other goals."}
{"13243": "D. Pervasive violence."}
{"13244": "A. Critical questioning."}
{"13245": "C. Capitalist market activities and technological and communication revolutions have increasingly intruded on traditional cultures and societies. Development inequalities and increasing marginalization of some ethnic or economic groups in the populations, alongside an increasing awareness of their dispossession provides grounds for breeding terrorism."}
{"13246": "D. All of these options."}
{"13247": "C. The set up continues to be one in which security studies is located between the IR discipline and technical experts and practitioners."}
{"13248": "D. All of these options."}
{"13249": "D. All of these options."}
{"13250": "D. All of these options."}
{"13251": "A. It is possible to study military security through non-realist analytical lenses, and to adopt a social constructivist approach that regards cultural and social factors as being important focuses of study. This has led to claims that broader approaches to military endeavours should be adopted, including the proposed employment of social and development specialists in conflict situations."}
{"13252": "D."}
{"13253": "A. Societal groups have a right to survive."}
{"13254": "D. To develop a new international justice system to enhance human security."}
{"13255": "D. Resilience refers to the ability of IT systems to recover from attack."}
{"13256": "D. All of the above are correct."}
{"13257": "B. A fusion reaction is created when the nuclei of two light elements are combined, the reaction resulting in heavier elements fragmenting into smaller parts. This fragmentation releases energy of limited destructive capacity, the extent of energy released dependent on the mass of material used."}
{"13258": "A. Materialism refers to HM's focus on class and the productive basis of societies, as well as the ways in which social structures have the capacity to change and produce change."}
{"13259": "D. All of these options."}
{"13260": "D."}
{"13261": "C. 2001 UN Security Council Resolution 1308 on HIV/AIDS as a National Security Threat."}
{"13262": "A. Women did not actively engage in warfare as combatants and so questions of gender or the role of women were not important in considerations of security."}
{"13263": "D. All of these options."}
{"13264": "B. Best described as intensification of worldwide social relations and increasing interdependence, globalization is the result of the compression of space and time through the development of new technologies."}
{"13265": "D. All of these options."}
{"13266": "D. All of these options."}
{"13267": "B. The security dilemma arises out of the anarchic international system that is conceptualized by realists. Within this environment, states are obliged to seek security through their own military efforts; this is perceived as threatening to other states and so triggers an arms race spiral. The security dilemma has implications for security sectors other than the military, particularly the political and societal security sectors."}
{"13268": "C."}
{"13269": "D. All of the above are correct."}
{"13270": "C. Not only state actors are involved in the defence trade. Non-state actors, including illegal groups, are also key players."}
{"13271": "C. The negativity attached to HM during the Cold War restricted the prominence of HM at this time, excluding it from mainstream security studies. Following this, the broadening of the security studies agenda has lead to increasing inclusion of HM as an area for study."}
{"13272": "D. All of these options."}
{"13273": "D. The East-West divide of the Cold War gave rise to a sharp divide between realists and early peace studies theorists. Whilst realists wished to focus research on that which would favour the survival of Western liberal democracies, advocates of peace studies regarded this approach as being narrow and Western ethnocentric."}
{"13274": "B. All of these options."}
{"13275": "A. The end of the Cold War created the space for security policy and security studies to be re-considered in light of growing environmental consciousness underlined by multilateralism in policy action."}
{"13276": "B."}
{"13277": "D. All of these options."}
{"13278": "D. All of the above"}
{"13279": "D. International trends such as globalization may have had the unintentional consequence of opening up new spaces for the development of transnational crime."}
{"13280": "D. All of these options."}
{"13281": "C."}
{"13282": "D. All of these options."}
{"13283": "C."}
{"13284": "D. During the Cold War most security analysts agreed that military security should be the focus of security studies; as a result, there was not much discussion about what security entailed, other than the military sector. Following this period security studies have been broadened to include the wider range of sectors that we see today, including environmental and political security."}
{"13285": "C."}
{"13286": "C."}
{"13287": "D. Peace studies is defined by a concern with the underlying causes of phenomena in IR, a global outlook, an interdisciplinary approach, the search for non-violent transformations, an analytical and normative approach, and the adoption of multi-level analysis that links theory and practice within research."}
{"13288": "C. Information plays a significant role in decision making because, although theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, 'rational action' depends on the information available to them at the time."}
{"13289": "D. All of these options."}
{"13290": "A. Digitalised sensitive information"}
{"13291": "B. Indiscriminate attack."}
{"13292": "C. A decrease in the arms trade."}
{"13293": "B."}
{"13294": "D. All of these options."}
{"13295": "A. Security is a socially constructed concept, relative to the society in which it exists, and what will constitute an existential threat is accordingly subjective."}
{"13296": "B. Social dominance of men over women that results from the designation of 'masculine' characteristics as more valued than 'feminine' characteristics."}
{"13297": "A. Institutional constraints limit the amount of resources to be spent on some good and force actors to choose how to manage the limited wealth available to them."}
{"13298": "D."}
{"13299": "D."}
{"13300": "D. All of these options."}
{"13301": "B. All of these options."}
{"13302": "D. Military security is the central concern of strategic studies; and strategic studies are a subset of security studies. Military security is one of the central concerns of security studies, and security studies is a subset of international relations."}
{"13303": "B."}
{"13304": "C. The demise of the ideological bipolar division of international society in the Cold War, rather than resulting in a reduction of hostilities, has left an unstable legacy where a policy of force and mass retaliation continues to pose a very real threat. Risk of uncontrollable escalation still remains but in a different form; mass casualty terrorism, contagion from failing states and non-state actors seeking to acquire WMD are the primary concern of states and require responses in the form of military intervention."}
{"13305": "C. The environment has been 'securitized' in the sense that environmental security has been used to make them matters of 'high politics'. This has to some degree raised the profile of critical issues among policymakers and agencies so that the environment can be considered an issue of security. But whilst the issue has been broadened there has been little change in policy and action in terms of the referent object of environmental security."}
{"13306": "D. The theory of securitization lacks coherence in terms of its employment as a tool for analytical studies in security."}
{"13307": "C. The traditional interpretations of security and threats are important boundaries that define human security."}
{"13308": "A. Securing the sustainable development of the state was dependent on societal security as an independent interest that was not secondary or dependent on the other sectors, including the military."}
{"13309": "D. A condition where people exist independently of state support, where human life is self-sufficient in that individuals do not require the assistance of state apparatus in order to live securely."}
{"13310": "D. All of the above"}
{"13311": "C. Commercial liberalism is probably the oldest faction of liberalism; advocating free trade as the free movement of goods and capital, it purports that the most rapid and efficient production of wealth occurs when governments do not restrict the economic activity of private actors and the free market."}
{"13312": "D. All of these options."}
{"13313": "A. An abuse of this power in order to wage state-interested wars."}
{"13314": "D. All of these options."}
{"13315": "D. The study of gender and of gender security issues is a complex task, and both terms elude a uniform definition. The concept of gender security broadens terms of security beyond the military sector to also include 'human security'."}
{"13316": "B. 'Security itself is a relative freedom from war, coupled with a relatively high expectation that defeat will not be a consequence of any war that should occur.' Bellamy, M."}
{"13317": "D. Acceptance that there can be no absolute security, instead design resilient IT systems and build international cooperation and information exchange in order to reduce threat and increase resilience."}
{"13318": "D. All of these options."}
{"13319": "A."}
{"13320": "B. A great deal of international diplomacy has involved attempts to define terrorism so that all countries could take steps to eradicate it. However, these efforts have largely faltered: countries often support or sympathize with dissidents who use violence against repressive governments; governments in developing countries have wanted to avoid anti-colonial struggles being labelled as terrorism; and countries want to retain a degree of flexibility regarding extradition and punishment of political dissidents."}
{"13321": "D. To account for all possible referent objects and expand the definition of security so far as to allow for a broadening of the school to encompass any agent that threatens those referent objects."}
{"13322": "D. All of these options."}
{"13323": "B. Anarchy refers to the lack of over-arching power in the international system - there is no controlling power beyond the multiple states. In the absence of such authority, states have their own agenda for achieving security, and can determine their own goals and behaviour."}
{"13324": "D. All of these options."}
{"13325": "C. Human society is a constant and unchanging phenomenon."}
{"13326": "B. The term refers to a set of formal or informal principles to which governmental actors subscribe in their decision-making on a particular subject."}
{"13327": "C. To achieve energy security is to secure the supply of energy that is needed in the current context and in the future, with regards to foreseeable changes in demand where relevant."}
{"13328": "A. The most important characteristics of weak states are their frequent inability to establish and maintain a monopoly of control over the instruments of violence. Even within states with well developed coercive power they do not always retain absolute loyalty and are faced with a real possibility of military intervention. Whilst armed forces are ill-equipped, poorly managed and prone to factional divisions, social actors are powerful enough to resist governance. Therefore, monopoly over the instruments of violence is infrequent."}
{"13329": "D. Security debates structured scholarship centred on offensive versus defensive realism, the relative importance of ideational variables and the role of power and institutions in orders and empires."}
{"13330": "D. All of these options."}
{"13331": "D. Hierarchical groups pose a serious degree of harm by their profit-driven crimes under centralized leadership. Targeting the proceeds or leadership would therefore produce a reduction in their threat on the legitimate economy."}
{"13332": "B. The concept of human security gained increasing currency in the mid-1990s, serving to highlight critical issues. In particular, the study of human society has focuses on the problem of intra-state violence, which has become the dominant issue for post-Cold War security studies."}
{"13333": "D. All of these options."}
{"13334": "B. Conveyed threat must be sufficient so as to make non-compliance unbearable; threat must be credible; adversary must be given sufficient time to comply with demand; coercer must assure adversary that compliance will not lead to future demands; conflict must not be perceived as a zero-sum game."}
{"13335": "C. Category B agents include food and water security threats, with moderate morbidity rates."}
{"13336": "B. 1990s"}
{"13337": "B."}
{"13338": "C. A culture characterized by friendship, where force and violence is eschewed in favour of cooperation in matters of security."}
{"13339": "D. All of these options."}
{"13340": "A. Women and children are dependent on the state for protection and Security Studies should include them and account for their needs."}
{"13341": "D. All of these options."}
{"13342": "C."}
{"13343": "D. Objective security: when a matter is objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation."}
{"13344": "C. An increasingly prevalent strategy among weak states has been the employment of private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries as force multipliers to secure the weak state from internal threats."}
{"13345": "A. Technological advancements have to some extent rendered the battlefield gender-neutral. 'Virtual' warfare has resolved the historical tension between the citizen and the state security apparatus; if actual combat could be avoided then male and female soldiers could wage war on equal terms. However, technological advancement remains unequal and so the gender situation is different in different contexts, depending on development and security issues."}
{"13346": "D. Looting and theft, especially where corruption is endemic, states are weak, and weapons stockpiles are not properly secured."}
{"13347": "D. All of these options."}
{"13348": "A."}
{"13349": "D. All of these options."}
{"13350": "A."}
{"13351": "A. Market place scholars argue that transnational crime operates like a capitalist marketplace in its scope and extensity of operations. Criminal organizations are thus very resilient to law enforcement efforts by virtue of their sheer size. Of comparative difference is the development of highly sophisticated networks of collaboration between criminal groups that has enabled them to survive under the conditions of the competitive logic of the marketplace."}
{"13352": "B. Warlord politics represented the entrenchment of traditional patterns of redistributive networks within society but maintained by alternative political sources. Assistance derived from superpowers was superseded by US hegemonic endorsement at the end of the Cold War."}
{"13353": "C. Chemical weapons have the potential to cause mass casualties. Moderate exposure to chemicals produces serious side effects and would generate serious casualties if weaponized."}
{"13354": "C. War is an anarchic state in which state or other actors must draw upon exceptional (military) means in order to ensure the protection of their interests."}
{"13355": "D. All of these options."}
{"13356": "B. Success is an independent function from the amount of coercion required to produce compliance. Ideally, coercion should be required to solve all disputes. If the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, the degree of success is equated to the production intended outcome: to stop or undo an action."}
{"13357": "D. All of these options. The environment is both an object to be secured and a source of risk, although it may mean different things to different people. Whilst deepening the concept of security it has both critical and practical dimensions although the utility of the concept is contested."}
{"13358": "D. All of these options."}
{"13359": "D. Culture is commonly regarded as a set of practices that give meaning to shared experiences and actions; it can impact on how states see security and is crucial in constructing the values and rules that inform identity."}
{"13360": "D. All of these options."}
{"13361": "C. The diversity of states, in terms of their cultural, political, ideological and religious values, results in a global system characterised by radical disagreements on how states should govern themselves and each other. In order to protect this diversity there exist rules of engagement that prohibit interference in the sovereign state, such as humanitarian intervention."}
{"13362": "C. All of these options."}
{"13363": "A. Military professionals believe that the majority of biological agents can be sufficiently stable in their effects to be used as a weapon. Resource requirements would be minimal as fermenters used to make vaccines could be converted for military production and relatively small quantities of the agent are required to produce highly lethal effects, making them an efficient and effective weapon."}
{"13364": "B."}
{"13365": "D."}
{"13366": "B. Ill health can threaten the state indirectly, but can also be a threat to other referent objects such as the economy."}
{"13367": "C. To prevent the securitization of irrelevant threats and to challenge the legitimacy of currently securitized threats."}
{"13368": "D. The perceived 'medicalization' of societies occurs when social issues are increasingly considered and responded to as medical problems."}
{"13369": "A. Health has long been regarded as a security issue. During the 20th century there was an increasingly sense of panic about the potential damage of a serious pandemic disease outbreak in the newly globalised world. Medical advances and a series of successful contained outbreaks have largely allayed these fears."}
{"13370": "A. Peace studies developed after the Second World War as a response to the failure of International Relations to prevent global conflict following World War I. Initially, the field was conditioned by the nuclear arms race and East-West divide that characterised the Cold War, but was quick to embrace environmental concerns and the issues surrounding the North-South wealth/poverty divide."}
{"13371": "D. All of these options."}
{"13372": "C. Military threats to societies in the form of external aggression, mainly through de-population policies with the intent of preventing collective identities from being reproduced over generations."}
{"13373": "B. Corporate identity refers to the intrinsic, self-realized identity of an actor. Social identity refers to 'sets of meanings that an actor attributes to itself while taking the perspective of others'. Actors can have multiple social identities."}
{"13374": "D. Analysis of environmental violence research shows that there is a tendency among 'strong states' to be less prone to internal violent conflicts whereas states undergoing significant economic and political transitions are more prone to violent conflict. Environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war but can be a contributory factor."}
{"13375": "D. The IT system has failed due to a random unexpected event, such as a tsunami which destroys key electronic equipment."}
{"13376": "D. All of these options."}
{"13377": "A. The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance."}
{"13378": "C. Anarchy is an inescapable feature of the international system."}
{"13379": "C. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels"}
{"13380": "B. Lacking infrastructural capacity and wider social legitimacy, weak state elites are often forced to rely on coercive power. However, a key dilemma is that the instruments of violence can be a threat to the regime requiring the deliberate undermining of armed forces."}
{"13381": "B. Yes, successful policies of arms control and deterrence have translated well from other security realms, such as nuclear weapons control strategies."}
{"13382": "D. All of these options."}
{"13383": "D. All of these options."}
{"13384": "D. All of these options."}
{"13385": "C. Non-governmental groups have played a significant and effective role in developing arms control measures in recent years."}
{"13386": "B. The responsibility to prevent."}
{"13387": "C. Development is a means to address the inequalities that accompany neoliberal globalization. In this context, development refers to the ability of a population or community to effectively utilize resources and increase efficiency in production and distribution, promoting the more equitable distribution of income within society."}
{"13388": "B. Eurocentrism is a thought style in which the assessment and evaluation of non-European societies is couched in terms of the cultural assumptions and biases of Europeans."}
{"13389": "D. Any crime that involves computers and networks"}
{"13390": "C. Revolutionary uprisings are likely to occur; people of the world who have been left behind by neoliberal globalisation can become radicalised and rebel against those who have benefitted from the economic policies that have failed them."}
{"13391": "D. WMD terrorism poses a security threat that is not easily met by today's policy community or military establishments. The second strike rule is virtually obsolete because of the difficulty of locating such groups and deterrence is an unviable strategy given that objective of attacks are frequently politically, ideologically or religiously motivated."}
{"13392": "C. Realism is based in the notion of causality whilst social constructivism relies on theories of identity that are based in intersubjective meanings."}
{"13393": "A. A virus or worm"}
{"13394": "D. Security studies creates and perpetuates claims that shape warfare, defining legitimacy, favouring some subjects and marginalising others."}
{"13395": "D. All of these options."}
{"13396": "C. Nations are defined by the boundaries and borders of the state."}
{"13397": "C. Feminist and critical security theory shows us that war can have gendered consequences. Recognition of those consequences has allowed us to address the way in which we think about 'male' and 'female' expectations in warfare, and has shaped the way in which we theorise, participate, and protest against those roles."}
{"13398": "D. Prevention is conceived as securing the physical integrity of targets and key political installations, particularly weapons installations, national buildings, national or cultural symbols, or defence deployments. Protecting possible targets of the state enhances the wellbeing of more vulnerable targets. Terrorists may move to more convenient territory to target their objectives which make it more difficult to control."}
{"13399": "D. The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary. In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool."}
{"13400": "D. All of these options."}
{"13401": "C. Goals."}
{"13402": "A. There is no specific referent point."}
{"13403": "C. The success ultimately rests on perceptual, psychological and emotional factors, giving rise to the risk that misperception or miscalculation will defeat even a well-executed strategy that otherwise meets all the requirements for success."}
{"13404": "C. the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers"}
{"13405": "A. how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources"}
