Gender roles are a social construct; the values that we attribute to masculinity or femininity, such as strength or care-giving, are the product of shared social ideals rather than innate biological properties. Men and women are equally able to care effectively for children or to conduct violent and aggressive behaviour. However, social constructs of gender roles are pervasive, and women are likely to be victims of gender-based violence in conflict whilst men are more likely to be involved as perpetrators of violence."}

{"13188": "A. Recent inquiry into the way in which women have been treated both in and after war has revealed a degree of ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women. While women have often been the targets of violence by the enemy in conflict, it is also the case that they may suffer at the hands of their \"protectors\". This strengthens the argument for female soldiers to be engaged in certain types of peacekeeping work, particularly in post-conflict situations."}
{"13189": "D. IFIs identified the economic failings of developing countries as being the result of political problems.

{"13203": "A. By regarding security as a socially constructed concept, constructivists assert that militarization is the result of governmental decisions based on shared values and cultural norms that underpin their conception of what constitutes a security risk. Accordingly, different governments will identify different threats and react in different ways."}

{"13206": "B."}
{"13207": "D."}
{"13208": "A.

{"13221": "D."}
{"13222": "C. An 'energy security nexus' exists in the international system because the geographical distribution of energy supply and demand are not equal; thus states are drawn into complex and intertwined relationships with one another."}

{"13224": "A. The international system is shaped through colonised discourse that establishes notions of certain states as inferior to others."}
{"13225": "C. The different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy: the problem-solving tradition in US political science vs. the critical studies in Europe."}
{"13226": "A. Traditional theories explain international politics as the distribution of power among members of an international system, and specifically as the balance of power amongst major states.

{"13250": "D. All of these options."}
{"13251": "A. It is possible to study military security through non-realist analytical lenses, and to adopt a social constructivist approach that regards cultural and social factors as being important focuses of study.

{"13267": "B. The security dilemma arises out of the anarchic international system that is conceptualized by realists. Within this environment, states are obliged to seek security through their own military efforts; this is perceived as threatening to other states and so triggers an arms race spiral.

During the Cold War most security analysts agreed that military security should be the focus of security studies; as a result, there was not much discussion about what security entailed, other than the military sector.

{"13294": "D. All of these options."}
{"13295": "A. Security is a socially constructed concept, relative to the society in which it exists, and what will constitute an existential threat is accordingly subjective."}
{"13296": "B. Social dominance of men over women that results from the designation of 'masculine' characteristics as more valued than 'feminine' characteristics."}
{"13297": "A. Institutional constraints limit the amount of resources to be spent on some good and force actors to choose how to manage the limited wealth available to them."}
{"13298": "D."}
{"13299": "D."}
{"13300": "D. All of these options."}
{"13301": "B. All of these options."}
{"13302": "C. Strategic studies are best conceptualized as a subset of international relations, and within strategic studies, military security is one of the dominant concerns. Security studies are a subset of strategic studies."}

{"13314": "D. All of these options."}
{"13315": "D."}
{"13316": "B. 'Security itself is a relative freedom from war, coupled with a relatively high expectation that defeat will not be a consequence of any war that should occur.' Bellamy, M."}
{"13317": "D. Acceptance that there can be no absolute security, instead design resilient IT systems and build international cooperation and information exchange in order to reduce threat and increase resilience."}
{"13318": "D. All of these options."}
{"13319": "A."}
{"13320": "B. A great deal of international diplomacy has involved attempts to define terrorism so that all countries could take steps to eradicate it. However, these efforts have largely faltered: countries often support or sympathize with dissidents who use violence against repressive governments; governments in developing countries have wanted to avoid anti-colonial struggles being labelled as terrorism; and countries want to retain a degree of flexibility regarding extradition and punishment of political dissidents."}
{"13321": "D."}
{"13322": "D."}
{"13323": "B. Anarchy refers to the lack of over-arching power in the international system - there is no controlling power beyond the multiple states. In the absence of such authority, states have their own agenda for achieving security, and can determine their own goals and behaviour."}
{"13324": "D. All of these options."}
{"13325": "C."}
{"13326": "B. The term refers to a set of formal or informal principles to which governmental actors subscribe in their decision-making on a particular subject."}
{"13327": "C. To achieve energy security is to secure the supply of energy that is needed in the current context and in the future, with regards to foreseeable changes in demand where relevant."}
{"13328": "A. The most important characteristics of weak states are their frequent inability to establish and maintain a monopoly of control over the instruments of violence. Even within states with well developed coercive power they do not always retain absolute loyalty and are faced with a real possibility of military intervention. Whilst armed forces are ill-equipped, poorly managed and prone to factional divisions, social actors are powerful enough to resist governance. Therefore, monopoly over the instruments of violence is infrequent."}
{"13329": "C. Security theory is a specific subset of security studies and one whose development has gone through distinctive phases and divided more strongly than comparable fields, often without mutual recognition."}
{"13330": "D. All of these options."}
{"13331": "D. Hierarchical groups pose a serious degree of harm by their profit-driven crimes under centralized leadership. Targeting the proceeds or leadership would therefore produce a reduction in their threat on the legitimate economy."}
{"13332": "B. The concept of human security gained increasing currency in the mid-1990s, serving to highlight critical issues. In particular, the study of human society has focuses on the problem of intra-state violence, which has become the dominant issue for post-Cold War security studies."}
{"13333": "D. All of these options."}

{"13342": "C."}
{"13343": "D. Objective security: when a matter is objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation."}
{"13344": "C. An increasingly prevalent strategy among weak states has been the employment of private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries as force multipliers to secure the weak state from internal threats."}
{"13345": "A."}
{"13346": "D. Looting and theft, especially where corruption is endemic, states are weak, and weapons stockpiles are not properly secured."}

{"13348": "A."}
{"13349": "D. All of these options."}
{"13350": "C."}
{"13351": "A. Market place scholars argue that transnational crime operates like a capitalist marketplace in its scope and extensity of operations. Criminal organizations are thus very resilient to law enforcement efforts by virtue of their sheer size. Of comparative difference is the development of highly sophisticated networks of collaboration between criminal groups that has enabled them to survive under the conditions of the competitive logic of the marketplace."}
{"13352": "B."}
{"13353": "C. Chemical weapons have the potential to cause mass casualties. Moderate exposure to chemicals produces serious side effects and would generate serious casualties if weaponized."}
{"13354": "C."}
{"13355": "D. All of these options."}
{"13356": "B. Success is an independent function from the amount of coercion required to produce compliance. Ideally, coercion should be required to solve all disputes. If the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, the degree of success is equated to the production intended outcome: to stop or undo an action."}
{"13357": "D. All of these options. The environment is both an object to be secured and a source of risk, although it may mean different things to different people. Whilst deepening the concept of security it has both critical and practical dimensions although the utility of the concept is contested."}
{"13358": "D. All of these options."}
{"13359": "D. Culture is commonly regarded as a set of practices that give meaning to shared experiences and actions; it can impact on how states see security and is crucial in constructing the values and rules that inform identity."}
{"13360": "D. All of these options."}
{"13361": "C."}
{"13362": "C."}
{"13363": "A. Military professionals believe that the majority of biological agents can be sufficiently stable in their effects to be used as a weapon. Resource requirements would be minimal as fermenters used to make vaccines could be converted for military production and relatively small quantities of the agent are required to produce highly lethal effects, making them an efficient and effective weapon."}
{"13364": "B."}
{"13365": "D."}
{"13366": "B. Ill health can threaten the state indirectly, but can also be a threat to other referent objects such as the economy."}
{"13367": "C. To prevent the securitization of irrelevant threats and to challenge the legitimacy of currently securitized threats."}
{"13368": "D. The perceived 'medicalization' of societies occurs when social issues are increasingly considered and responded to as medical problems."}
{"13369": "D. During the 20th century, security analysts were predisposed to focus on the potential threat of nuclear confrontation and military combat. Since the reduction in these threats, there has emerged a series of pandemic diseases, and a sense of growing unease at the future impact of more serious outbreaks in an increasingly globalised population."}
{"13370": "A. Peace studies developed after the Second World War as a response to the failure of International Relations to prevent global conflict following World War I. Initially, the field was conditioned by the nuclear arms race and East-West divide that characterised the Cold War, but was quick to embrace environmental concerns and the issues surrounding the North-South wealth/poverty divide."}
{"13371": "D. All of these options."}
{"13372": "C. Military threats to societies in the form of external aggression, mainly through de-population policies with the intent of preventing collective identities from being reproduced over generations."}
{"13373": "B. Corporate identity refers to the intrinsic, self-realized identity of an actor. Social identity refers to 'sets of meanings that an actor attributes to itself while taking the perspective of others'. Actors can have multiple social identities."}
{"13374": "D. Analysis of environmental violence research shows that there is a tendency among 'strong states' to be less prone to internal violent conflicts whereas states undergoing significant economic and political transitions are more prone to violent conflict. Environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war but can be a contributory factor."}
{"13375": "D."}
{"13376": "D. All of these options."}
{"13377": "A. The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance."}
{"13378": "C."}
{"13379": "C. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels"}
{"13380": "B. Lacking infrastructural capacity and wider social legitimacy, weak state elites are often forced to rely on coercive power. However, a key dilemma is that the instruments of violence can be a threat to the regime requiring the deliberate undermining of armed forces."}
{"13381": "B. Yes, successful policies of arms control and deterrence have translated well from other security realms, such as nuclear weapons control strategies."}
{"13382": "D."}
{"13383": "D."}
{"13384": "D. All of these options."}
{"13385": "C."}
{"13386": "B. The responsibility to prevent."}
{"13387": "C. Development is a means to address the inequalities that accompany neoliberal globalization. In this context, development refers to the ability of a population or community to effectively utilize resources and increase efficiency in production and distribution, promoting the more equitable distribution of income within society."}
{"13388": "B. Eurocentrism is a thought style in which the assessment and evaluation of non-European societies is couched in terms of the cultural assumptions and biases of Europeans."}
{"13389": "D. Any crime that involves computers and networks"}
{"13390": "C. Revolutionary uprisings are likely to occur; people of the world who have been left behind by neoliberal globalisation can become radicalised and rebel against those who have benefitted from the economic policies that have failed them."}
{"13391": "D."}
{"13392": "C."}
{"13393": "A. A virus or worm"}

{"13395": "D. All of these options."}
{"13396": "C."}
{"13397": "C."}
{"13398": "D. Prevention is conceived as securing the physical integrity of targets and key political installations, particularly weapons installations, national buildings, national or cultural symbols, or defence deployments. Protecting possible targets of the state enhances the wellbeing of more vulnerable targets. Terrorists may move to more convenient territory to target their objectives which make it more difficult to control."}
{"13399": "D. The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary. In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool."}
{"13400": "D. All of these options."}
{"13401": "C. Goals."}
{"13402": "A. There is no specific referent point."}
{"13403": "C. The success ultimately rests on perceptual, psychological and emotional factors, giving rise to the risk that misperception or miscalculation will defeat even a well-executed strategy that otherwise meets all the requirements for success."}
